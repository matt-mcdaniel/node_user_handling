# About

This is an example of an React application for user administration. This application uses the Redux architecture for managing data.

This application uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](http://expressjs.com/en/index.html) to distribute resources to the front-end. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to manage development and build tasks. This application uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html) to manage front-end view components. The project is using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile ES2015 JavaScript code.
